"""Station horror stories: an anonymous mini-forum in its own SQLite file.

Same ownership story as feedback.py: the delays DuckDB is read-only and the
file is swapped out nightly, so durable state the app owns lives in a
per-module SQLite file under its own data/ subdirectory (the pipeline rebuilds
and prunes files directly under data/).

Reading is anonymous; posting, commenting and voting need an account (see
auth.py), which pins every post to one stable name and makes votes count once
per person instead of once per browser. Accounts themselves live in Firebase;
the only trace of one here is the opaque Firebase uid on its votes and taps
(what makes them count once) and the public username on its posts. The
per-IP throttles live in memory.
