A bahn.de-style train connection search that shows the **median arrival delay of the last 7 days** (window selectable up to 30) for every connection, so you can book the one that actually runs on time. "Booking" deep-links to the real bahn.de page pre-filled with the journey.

## Features

- **Delay statistics per leg**: median arrival delay over the last 7/15/30 days, per-day charts, and the official IRIS delay causes behind every badge.
- **Four countries**: Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and France — cross-border journeys get statistics on every leg.
- **Transfer-risk warnings**: connections the arriving train's delay history makes tight or unlikely are flagged, and journeys can be sorted by connection risk.
- **Five sort modes**: departure time, least delay, cheapest price, lowest connection risk, fewest transfers.
- **Compensation checker**: reconstructs a past journey as it actually ran — exact delays, missed or cancelled connections, the replacement trains a passenger would have taken — and computes DB Fahrgastrechte compensation (25 %/50 %) with a deep link into the bahn.de claim flow.
- **Same-day results**: a journey is checkable minutes after arrival via live IRIS lookups, showing the same value the nightly build will store.
- **DE/EN interface**, shareable search URLs, station autocomplete served from the local delay data.

## How it works

- **Journey search**: the bahn.de web API (`www.bahn.de/web/api`) provides journey options including transfers and prices — the same API the bahn.de website uses. Station autocomplete is answered from the local delay data, falling back to that API for stations without delay history.
- **Historical delays, Germany**: the public HuggingFace dataset [piebro/deutsche-bahn-data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/piebro/deutsche-bahn-data) publishes raw Deutsche Bahn IRIS timetable responses every 6 hours. The pipeline keeps a rolling 31-day mirror and builds a per-stop delay table covering all German stations.
- **Historical delays, Switzerland, France, Austria, and the Netherlands**: official istdaten daily files (opentransportdata.swiss), 24/7 pollers on the official SNCF GTFS-RT feed and OVapi's Dutch train GTFS-RT feed, and a 24/7 poller sweeping ÖBB HAFAS (Scotty) station boards for the ~200 busiest Austrian stations produce per-day tables in the same schema; NL history is seeded from the Rijden de Treinen monthly train archive; Belgium comes from Infrabel's open raw punctuality files (yesterday's records every morning, the monthly files as backfill), filtered to commercial stops; `pipeline/merge_delays.py` unions all countries into the served table.
- **Today's delays**: for a journey the nightly pipeline has not ingested yet, delays are read at request time from the [DB Timetables API](https://developers.deutschebahn.com/db-api-marketplace/apis/product/timetables) (IRIS `plan` + `fchg`) — the same field the pipeline stores, so the answer does not change later. Optional: set `DB_API_KEY`/`DB_CLIENT_ID` (e.g. in a `.env`); without them the site simply stops at the last ingested day.
- **Matching**: each train leg of a journey is matched against history by train number + arrival-station EVA + time-of-day proximity (±120 min), one closest match per calendar day. The median arrival delay at the leg destination is taken over the matched days; cancelled days are excluded from the median but counted.

## Setup

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)
- git

### 1. Clone with the submodule

The delay pipeline imports the parser from the `deutsche-bahn-data` submodule, so it must be checked out:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sha2nkt/delay_bahn.git
cd delay_bahn
```

If you already cloned without `--recurse-submodules`:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

This creates `.venv/` and installs everything from `uv.lock` (FastAPI, DuckDB, pandas, huggingface-hub, ...).

### 3. Build the delay table

The app needs the merged delay table before it can show delay stats — it opens `data/delays.duckdb` (built by `merge_delays.py`), or falls back to loading `data/delays.parquet` into memory if the db file is absent:

```bash
uv run python pipeline/build_delay_db.py            # full window (default: 31 days)
uv run python pipeline/build_delay_db.py --days 3   # quick smoke run
uv run python pipeline/merge_delays.py              # write data/delays.parquet + the data/delays.duckdb the app opens
```

This downloads raw parquet files from the HuggingFace dataset into `data/raw_data/` (~5.5 GB for the full window; `data/de/delays.parquet` adds another ~720 MB), parses each day once into the `data/de/parsed/` cache, and merges them into `data/de/delays.parquet`. Re-run it daily to stay fresh — already-downloaded days are skipped and only days with new raw files are re-parsed. No HuggingFace account or token is needed; the dataset is public. `merge_delays.py` then combines the per-country tables (DE alone is fine) into `data/delays.parquet` and materializes the sorted `data/delays.duckdb` the app serves from.

### 4. Run the app

```bash
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000
```

Open http://localhost:8000, search a connection (e.g. Berlin Hbf → München Hbf), sort by "Wenigste Verspätung".
