# Cron watchdog for delaybahn.com: alerts via ntfy on state changes, and keeps
# re-paging while an upstream block stays unresolved (see check 2).
# Runs on ps083, outside the Hetzner box, so it catches server, tunnel and app
# failures alike. curl -4 because ps083 advertises broken IPv6.
#
# Three independent checks:
#   1. DOWN: /health unreachable / non-200 (as before).
#   2. UPSTREAM BLOCKED: bahn.de (Akamai) hard-blocking the server IP, detected
#      from /health's own counters: upstream_403 rising while upstream_200 stays
#      flat. During the 2026-08-19 OPS_BLOCKED incident the app stayed healthy
#      (circuit breaker + stale cache) and /health stayed 200, so neither the
#      systemd OnFailure hooks nor the old status-code check ever fired.
#      A block is not self-healing (it needs an IP move), so unlike check 1 it
#      keeps re-paging every BLOCK_REMIND_SECONDS until 200s return, carrying
#      the elapsed duration so the reminders read as one ongoing incident.
#   3. GREY MAP: the all-trains map's German dots turn grey (timetable only)
#      when the realtime feed stops matching our trips. /health fleet.rtTrips is
#      ~3,900 by day; on 2026-10-03 a gtfs.de timetable release with renumbered
#      trips dropped it to ~300 for hours, unnoticed. Alerts after
#      GREY_WINDOWS consecutive windows of rtTrips < GREY_MIN_TRIPS or a feed
#      read older than 10 min, 07-22 Berlin only (few trains run at night), and
#      once more on recovery. A restart's rebuild (rtTrips 0 for ~5 min) stays
#      under the window count.
#
# Testing: DRY_RUN=1 prints alerts instead of sending; HEALTH_FILE=<path>
# feeds the detector a canned /health body instead of hitting the network;
# BLOCK_REMIND_SECONDS=0 makes every window re-page so the reminder path can
# be exercised without waiting.
